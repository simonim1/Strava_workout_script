# Strava_workout_script
I started getting into body building routines and I track them in strava.
Some friends were curious about my routine, and I do like putting my notes about my routine in the app. 
The problem is that typing it all on my phone is alot for each workout.
Here is a script to write what work out day I was doing and all the movements I did . 

## How others can use this
this is more for people that work out 5 days a week but you can doctor my scripts for you as well.
what is needed
* a csv of all the workouts 
* strava application

### How to Run the application
